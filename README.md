Netgear's D7000 Nighthawk Router Experience Distributed Project

This distributed project has the purpose of improving:

a) the embedded software developing experience;

b) the router performances, ability and reliability.

The word 'distributed' is intended with the same meaning of the git developing system philosophy. 
People are a resource: those interested with up to tiny unix programming or www knowledge may give
their own contribute with everything useful. 

The approach is typical learn-to-learn oriented: feel free to partecipate.
